## Running the Application

1. Install `Node.js 8.9` or higher.  
IMPORTANT: The server uses ES2015 features AND the Angular CLI so you need this version of Node.js!!!!*

1. Run `npm install` to install app dependencies

1. Run `ng build --watch` to build and bundle the code

1. Run `npm start` in a separate terminal window to build the TypeScript, watch for changes and launch the web server

1. Go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser 

Simply clone the project or download and extract the .zip to get started. 

Once the app is running you can play around with editing customers after you login. Use any email address and any password that's at least 6 characters long (with 1 digit).

## Running Angular Playground

This application includes Angular Playground (http://www.angularplayground.it) which provides a great way to isolate components in a sandbox rather than loading the 
entire application to see a given component. To run the playground run the following command:

`npm run playground`
